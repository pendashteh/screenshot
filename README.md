# screenshot
In terminal, create a snapshot of part of the screen, use it immediately and forget about it.

# Usecase
I want to quickly take a screen grab of part of my screen and share it with coleagues or on the issue queue.

# Step 1. Take a screenshot
`$ screenshot [filename]`
Now you can use your mouse to choose part of the screen for the shot

# Step 2. Use the file
It captures the shot and gives you the path to the file that is created temporarily. If you have specified the filename it has saved it with that name.

# Step 3. Forget about it 
If you haven't specified the filename and you have used the temporary file already, you can forget about it. It will ask you however, if you want to keep it. If you say 'y', it will keep the file.
