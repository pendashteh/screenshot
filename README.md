# screenshot
In terminal, create a snapshot of part of the screen, use it immediately and forget about it.

# Usecase
I want to quickly take a screen grab of part of my screen and share it with coleagues or on the issue queue.

# Step 1. Take a screenshot
`$ screenshot`
Now you can use your mouse to choose part of the screen for the shot

# Step 2. Use th file
It captures the shot and gives you the path to the file that is created temporarily.

# Step 3. Forget about it
Now that you have used the file, you can forget about it. It will ask you however, if you want to keep it. If you say 'y', it will keep the file.
